    <h1>Tips Brave Nine</h1>
    <h2>⚔️ WARRIOR ROUTE ⚔️</h2>
    <p>🎯 Reroll Target 🎯</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Lakshmi, 4 Garuda, & 1 Kumari (Recommended)</li>
        <li>or</li>
        <li>1 Kumari, 4 Soma, & 1 Lakshmi</li>
    </ul>
    <p>🗒 : It's a ideal result, if below that, then it means just standard result like 1x Legend Merc & 4 Legend Comps. Below from standard result, than It's worse/bad.</p>
    <p>🔱 Mythic Mercs To Acquire 🔱</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Iselok : Evil Sword Vanar(2nd) + ADV Debuff Immunity(3rd) + Armor Slash(4th)</li>
        <p>🗒 : It's Ideal/perfect Iselok for Arena atm (most used). Other than it, like Rotk/HSV, mostly used for Guild War atm.</p>
        <li>Eda : Authority of Goddess(2nd) + Blessing(3rd) + Enhanced Barrier Bestowal/Regeneration Barrier Bestowal(4th)</li>
        <p>🗒 : For 4th skill, It's optional/depend, as long as it's not Noble Sacrifice.</p>
        <li>Frellea : PHP Boost(2nd) + Concentrated Defense(3rd) + Blade Flurry(4th, Ideal)</li>
        <p>🗒 : Last thing to get. Recommend to pull when you run team with Delsa.</p>
    </ul>
    <p>⚜️ Legends ⚜️</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lucius & 4 Luvencia</li>
        <li>Lain & 4 Kali</li>
        <li>Seto & 4 Aquila (A choice if you're running team with Delsahidne. If you're in Origin, then you can acquire/get him from JSQ)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>🗒 : Atm, legend mercenaries that consistantly used are Lakshmi, Lain and Lucius for warrior team, the other spot is filled by Mythics & 5* mercs.</p>
    <p>5⭐️ Mercenaries</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Delsahidne/Merry (Both are for warrior team, can be mixed/bring together, but mostly they're in separated forms, both have + - and Merry used more by people atm).</li>
        <li>Agni</li>
        <li>Anastasia</li>
        <li>Haruna (Make her to +15 ASAP, will help you in contents like WB Hunt/GR/Voyage/and Other PvE stuffs in early.)</li>
        <li>Mary (If you're running a team with Merry)</li>
        <li>Veronia (If you're running a team with Delsa in early)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>🗒 : There are other 5* mercenaries to mentioned but since what I focus here is for early objectives, I don't think it's necesarry to mention all of them atm. You will know what you need later. Anastasia and Mary/Veronia you can get them from JSQ.</p>
